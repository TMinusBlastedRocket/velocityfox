\f0\fs24 \cf0 # InterWebPPC: Mozilla for Power Macintosh \
# (based on the now defunct TenFourFox)\
\
A fork of Firefox to maintain support for the Power Mac, supporting Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, with special features and optimizations for PowerPC processors and AltiVec. _This project is not affiliated with nor supported by Mozilla in any way, and is not an official build._ **PowerPC forever!**\
\
InterWebPPC is a slightly more optimized version of TenFourFox. I've disabled or removed deprecated services (like shumway) to reduce unneeded overhead. This results in a lighter and faster browser.\
\
I highly recommend using this package if you plan to build this yourself. It's what i use. \
Current build machine is a 1.6ghz PowerMac G5 w/4gb ram.\
