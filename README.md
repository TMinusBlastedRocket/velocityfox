# InterWebPPC: Mozilla for Power Macintosh 
# (based on the now defunct TenFourFox)

A fork of Firefox to maintain support for the Power Mac, supporting Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, with special features and optimizations for PowerPC processors and AltiVec. _This project is not affiliated with nor supported by Mozilla in any way, and is not an official build._ **PowerPC forever!**

Recommend using this package if you plan to build this yourself. I did. 
Current build machine is a 1.6ghz PowerMac G5 w/4gb ram.
