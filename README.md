# InterWebPPC: Mozilla for Power Macintosh 
# Based on the now defunct TenFourFox (see below)

A fork of Firefox to maintain support for the Power Mac, supporting Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, with special features and optimizations for PowerPC processors and AltiVec. _This project is not affiliated with nor supported by Mozilla in any way, and is not an official build._ **PowerPC forever!**

InterWebPPC is a slightly more optimized version of TenFourFox. I've disabled or removed deprecated services (like shumway) to reduce unneeded overhead. This results in a lighter and faster browser.

I highly recommend using this package if you plan to build this yourself. It's what i use. 
Current build machine is a 1.6ghz PowerMac G5 w/4gb ram.

# TenFourFox: Mozilla for Power Macintosh

A fork of Firefox to maintain support for the Power Mac, supporting Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, with special features and optimizations for PowerPC processors and AltiVec. _This project is not affiliated with nor supported by Mozilla in any way, and is not an official build._ **PowerPC forever!**

This project is specifically for Mac OS X 10.4+. If you're looking for a browser for Mac OS 8.6-10.3, look at our sister project, [Classilla](http://www.classilla.org/).

**TenFourFox is a "hobby" project: you build it yourself, with no guarantees on updates, update frequency, security or stability.** Our Github project site houses our source code, [documentation wiki](https://github.com/classilla/tenfourfox/wiki) with complete build instructions, and [the current worklist](https://github.com/classilla/tenfourfox/issues). For archived downloads, language packs and contributed tools, visit our [SourceForge download repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tenfourfox/files/). **There is no support for any version of TenFourFox.** The current update source is Firefox 102ESR.

**If you file a Github issue without a patch, or without declaring your intention to file a pull request addressing that issue, it may be summarily closed or deleted at the maintainer's sole discretion.** The issue list is an active worklist, and if no work will occur on an issue, even if the issue is real and verifiable, it will be closed. There are lots of acknowledged deficiencies in TenFourFox and not everyone is going to prioritize a deficiency the way you might. If you are not willing or able to fix your most important issues yourself, you may not want to use this browser.

The `wiki/` branch contains old documentation and release notes from our former Google Code wiki. They are no longer updated or maintained. Take care as links in those documents have probably rotted.
